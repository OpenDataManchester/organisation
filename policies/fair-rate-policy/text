Rates for freelance staff.

As Open Data Manchester’s programme is set to grow over the coming months and to enable us to do this, we are going to have to employ part-time and temporary staff.

From research - job sites, freelance platforms and speaking to people,  I have managed to put together the following table. There are a couple of methodologies that I have employed to do this. One is to take a sample of hourly rates, remove the outliers and average from Pay by the Hour.. The second was to look at job recruitment sites and take a sample of rates and do something similar.

The rates are banded into four bands

Band 1  Back office, administrative, project support, facilitation support
        Half day rate   Day rate    Weekly    Fortnightly
        100.00          175.00      790.00    1,575.00
        
Band 2  Project management, facilitation, marketing, copywriting, data analytics and research
        Half day rate   Day rate    Weekly    Fortnightly
        140.00          250.00       1,125.00 2,250.00
        
Band 3  Technical - coding, developer, data standards and visualisation
        Half day rate   Day rate    Weekly    Fortnightly
        170.00          300.00      1,350.00  2,700.00
        
Band 4  Expert - consultant
        Half day rate   Day rate    Weekly    Fortnightly
        225.00          400.00      1,800.00  3,600.00

The rates are worked out as:
Half day rate is day rate / 8 * 4.5 and rounded to the nearest £10
Weekly (contiguous days) daily rate * 4.5 rounded to the nearest £10
Fortnightly (contiguous days) daily rate * 9 rounded to the nearest £10

For longer periods of employment or work that doesn’t easily fit into the tables then we would look at fixed sum contracts or temporary employment.
